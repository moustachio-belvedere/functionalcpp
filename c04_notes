in the currying API example, does this suggest a a heuristic to bear in mind when deciding the order of arguments in client facing APIs?

shell utility tr?

tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' |
   tr A-Z a-z      |
   sort            |
   uniq -c         |
   sort -rn        |
   sed ${1}q

the imperative vs functional verbosity comparison seems unfair as it doesn't consider the amount of code used to generate each of those unix utilities.
